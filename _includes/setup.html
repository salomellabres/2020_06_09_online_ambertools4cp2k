          The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and
	  Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything.
	  You access Bash from the Terminal (found in
	  <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
          See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
          for an example on how to open the Terminal.
          You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
             To see if your default shell is Bash
            type <code>echo $SHELL</code> in Terminal and press the enter/return key.
            If the message printed does not end with '/bash' then your default is something else and you can run
            Bash by typing <code>bash</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to change your default shell, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208050" rel="noopener">
          this Apple Support article</a> and follow the instructions on "How to change your default shell".

          The default shell is usually Bash and there is usually no need to
          install anything.

          To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code> in
          a terminal and press the enter/return key.  If the message printed does
	  not end with '/bash' then your default is something else and you can run
	  Bash by typing <code>bash</code>.

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
